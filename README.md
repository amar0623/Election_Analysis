## Election Summary
This script could be used to analyze any election.
An easy modification for this code to analyze a different data set would be to change the file location and name the code reads from.

Another modification that is easy to make is to make sure that the script is reading from the correct column in the new data set.

The "election_results.csv" file that I used for this analysis may have a different number of columns or columns that vary in order from a new data set. Checking that the code is reading the correct column is necessary for for accurate results.
